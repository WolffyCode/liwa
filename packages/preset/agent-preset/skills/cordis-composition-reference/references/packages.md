# Loadable Liwa plugin packages

This file is GENERATED from workspace manifests (`scripts/gen-plugin-packages.ts`) and verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-plugin-packages` (part of `doc-sync`); do not edit it by hand.

Every package below exports a Cordis plugin that a bundle patch can name in a Loader row. `Config` marks packages whose row accepts a `config` mapping; query `Config.listConfigs` through `cordis_inspect_query` (filter by `name`, then query the `entry` id) for the mounted schema. Packages under `experimental` are pre-stable.
